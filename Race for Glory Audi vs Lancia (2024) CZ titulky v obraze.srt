1
00:01:41,753 --> 00:01:44,147
Sorry, let's get a move on
because I don't have much time.

2
00:01:44,321 --> 00:01:46,975
No, no, don't worry. This'll
only take a few minutes.

3
00:01:47,062 --> 00:01:48,062
Okay.

4
00:01:50,109 --> 00:01:51,328
We are recording.

5
00:01:53,068 --> 00:01:54,418
The World Rally Championship

6
00:01:54,548 --> 00:01:56,507
has grown in popularity
in recent years

7
00:01:56,637 --> 00:01:59,423
to become the number one
TV sport in the world.

8
00:01:59,553 --> 00:02:01,860
Drivers like Walter Roöhrl
and the Queen of Speed,

9
00:02:02,034 --> 00:02:04,384
Michele Mouton, have
become household names.

10
00:02:04,558 --> 00:02:06,430
This week we turn our attention

11
00:02:06,517 --> 00:02:09,215
to the key players off the
track, the team managers.

12
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:12,958
We're joined by team
manager, Cesare Fiorio,

13
00:02:13,045 --> 00:02:14,873
hailing from Turin, Italy.

14
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,920
Fiorio has led both Fiat
and Lancia to victory.

15
00:02:19,051 --> 00:02:21,532
Mr. Fiorio, pleased
to meet you.

16
00:02:22,402 --> 00:02:24,926
My pleasure. But
please, call me Cesare.

17
00:02:25,013 --> 00:02:27,015
Cesare, I'd like to
start by asking you

18
00:02:27,102 --> 00:02:29,540
what drew you to rallying?

19
00:02:29,627 --> 00:02:33,326
Well, probably because I
love the speed and the risk.

20
00:02:33,457 --> 00:02:35,198
Is that not true of
any other motor sport?

21
00:02:35,285 --> 00:02:37,417
Oh, rallying is very different.

22
00:02:37,504 --> 00:02:39,245
Rallying belongs to everyone.

23
00:02:39,419 --> 00:02:42,030
Let's say it's a
democratic sport.

24
00:02:42,117 --> 00:02:43,684
What do you mean by that?

25
00:02:43,771 --> 00:02:45,860
It's very difficult
to explain rally.

26
00:02:46,818 --> 00:02:47,949
You have to live it.

27
00:02:49,168 --> 00:02:53,346
You see, the spectators, they feel
the same speed as the drivers,

28
00:02:53,433 --> 00:02:56,697
because you know, you
race in your own town.

29
00:02:56,784 --> 00:02:59,744
The cars hurtle past
your children's school,

30
00:02:59,831 --> 00:03:02,964
the cafe where you used to have
your coffee, normal places.

31
00:03:03,051 --> 00:03:05,924
Rallying isn't as
well known in the US.

32
00:03:06,011 --> 00:03:08,970
Could you tell our
listeners what your role is?

33
00:03:09,057 --> 00:03:13,758
Let's say rallying is like a war,
and I'm the commander of an army.

34
00:03:13,845 --> 00:03:16,978
The world championship
is made up of 13 trials

35
00:03:17,065 --> 00:03:20,199
divided into grueling stages,

36
00:03:20,286 --> 00:03:25,552
long transfers, by day, by night,
in dust, sand, snow, rain, you know.

37
00:03:25,726 --> 00:03:27,641
But what is it
exactly that you do?

38
00:03:29,513 --> 00:03:32,951
What I do is to make decisions
in the shortest possible time.

39
00:03:33,821 --> 00:03:36,017
So if we look at the results
of last year's championship,

40
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:37,695
we could say that your rival,

41
00:03:37,782 --> 00:03:41,829
Roland Gumpert, made
better decisions than you.

42
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:44,963
What does Audi have
that you don't?

43
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:48,532
Well, an entire industrial
and financial sector

44
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:51,274
that supports research
and development.

45
00:03:51,361 --> 00:03:53,450
Do you know the four-wheel
drive is derived

46
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:56,148
from military technology?

47
00:03:56,235 --> 00:03:58,237
They really did bring the army.

48
00:04:00,457 --> 00:04:03,808
Rallying is a dangerous sport.
Does anything frighten you?

49
00:04:05,636 --> 00:04:06,636
Yeah.

50
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:08,290
One thing.

51
00:04:09,117 --> 00:04:10,380
Losing.

52
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,264
Audi is leading in Portugal.

53
00:04:25,438 --> 00:04:27,919
They're ahead of everyone on the
overall constructor standings.

54
00:04:32,663 --> 00:04:34,317
<i>In the cold Finnish night,</i>

55

<i>Now over to the traffic news.</i>

74
00:07:03,988 --> 00:07:05,903
Yes, Mr Gumpert, immediately.

75
00:07:09,776 --> 00:07:10,908
Stop!

76
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,137
Again!

77
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:33,060
Stop!

78
00:07:36,237 --> 00:07:38,849
- It's running better than last year.
- Perfect!

79
00:07:40,198 --> 00:07:41,678
Almost perfect.

80
00:07:42,853 --> 00:07:44,158
Start again!

81
00:08:45,176 --> 00:08:47,874
Sir, they've
dismantled the Audi.

82
00:08:48,353 --> 00:08:51,922
Look how wonderful
this joint is.

83
00:08:52,009 --> 00:08:55,316
The transmission has a differential
that splits the pair at 50%.

84
00:08:55,578 --> 00:08:59,538
And it does so using two axles,
one below and one above...

85
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:03,716
with two coaxial shafts,
one inside the other.

86
00:09:04,499 --> 00:09:07,894
When the Germans do things, they
definitely do them well, eh?

87
00:09:09,113 --> 00:09:10,549
Not always.

88
00:09:11,289 --> 00:09:13,944
Do you know how to tell
German wine from vinegar?

89
00:09:14,031 --> 00:09:15,989
- No.
- Read the labels.

90
00:09:20,211 --> 00:09:23,475
We need to develop four-wheel
drive technology as well.

91
00:09:23,562 --> 00:09:24,911
But we don't have the time.

92
00:09:29,307 --> 00:09:31,178
We need something like that.

93
00:09:32,179 --> 00:09:35,705
Short wheelbase, very
light, mid-engine.

94
00:09:35,922 --> 00:09:37,358
The Stratos could fly.

95
00:09:38,577 --> 00:09:39,970
Sir,

96
00:09:40,187 --> 00:09:42,842
- they're waiting at the meeting.
- I'll be right there.

97
00:09:45,453 --> 00:09:47,107
- Ennio, take this.
- Yes.

98
00:09:47,325 --> 00:09:49,762
- You come up with me.
- Sir, like this, I'm...

99
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,504
Yes, like that! I'll wait
for you upstairs. Hurry up!

100
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:03,471
- Good morning, Avvocato.
- Good morning.

101
00:10:06,823 --> 00:10:09,652
Do you want to know a
curious thing, Mr. Fiorio?

102
00:10:10,304 --> 00:10:13,481
Do you know what my grandson asked
me for as a birthday present?

103
00:10:13,612 --> 00:10:15,483
An Audi Quattro.

104
00:10:18,965 --> 00:10:20,575
These Germans are good.

105
00:10:21,707 --> 00:10:23,361
Work hard!

106
00:10:23,709 --> 00:10:25,145
And good luck.

107
00:10:28,845 --> 00:10:30,411
It's impossible
to beat them now.

108
00:10:30,629 --> 00:10:32,413
We don't have this winning car.

109
00:10:32,631 --> 00:10:34,372
We're too far behind
on the all-wheel drive.

110
00:10:34,589 --> 00:10:37,070
The technological gap with
the Germans is frightening.

111
00:10:37,288 --> 00:10:39,551
Even if we started work tomorrow

112
00:10:39,638 --> 00:10:41,684
and doubled the R&D budget,

113
00:10:41,771 --> 00:10:43,598
we wouldn't get a
competitive car.

114
00:10:43,816 --> 00:10:45,339
It'll take at least
two, three years.

115
00:10:45,426 --> 00:10:48,168
Forgive me, sir. With the money
for the racing department,

116
00:10:48,386 --> 00:10:50,649
we could run a powerful
advertising campaign.

117
00:10:50,867 --> 00:10:53,565
If you want to reconsider our
proposal, it's on page three.

118
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:56,699
Excuse me, but we can't do
anything with happy families

119
00:10:56,786 --> 00:10:59,658
leaving for their summer
vacation in a Lancia.

120
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:02,661
The only possible
advert is to win.

121
00:11:04,141 --> 00:11:06,534
No one wants to buy
a car that loses.

122
00:11:07,187 --> 00:11:10,016
Fiorio, I'm not asking you
to win, but to lose well.

123
00:11:10,103 --> 00:11:11,844
But you can't lose well.

124
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:14,107
You can only lose badly.

125
00:11:14,717 --> 00:11:17,589
I want to win this world
championship, whatever it takes.

126
00:11:18,285 --> 00:11:19,286
Ennio.

127
00:11:23,856 --> 00:11:26,598
This is a plan of
the Audi Quattro.

128
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,993
Longitudinal,
five-cylinder engine.

129
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:32,343
Maximum torque of
285 Newton/meters.

130
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,694
Central differential, rear
axle identical to the front,

131
00:11:35,955 --> 00:11:38,305
except it's rotated 180 degrees

132
00:11:38,392 --> 00:11:42,483
so it can interface with
the transmission shaft.

133
00:11:42,788 --> 00:11:44,659
Incredible road holding.

134
00:11:45,051 --> 00:11:46,923
It sticks to the ground.

135
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:48,810
You have to scrape the
asphalt off the wheels.

136
00:11:49,795 --> 00:11:53,016
Apparently unbeatable, but...

137
00:11:53,103 --> 00:11:54,931
2,900 lbs.

138
00:11:55,453 --> 00:11:58,064
They're heavy. Very heavy.

139
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:01,067
- They'll see this in Greece.
- One thing still isn't clear.

140
00:12:01,328 --> 00:12:03,635
Which car are we
taking to Greece?

141
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:05,593
The Monte Carlo Beta project.

142
00:12:10,468 --> 00:12:11,948
Mid-engine.

143
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:13,732
Two-wheel drive.

144
00:12:13,993 --> 00:12:15,734
Rear-wheel drive.

145
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,650
A racing car.

146
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,740
Of course...

147
00:12:22,001 --> 00:12:24,569
on snow and dirt
roads, we'll lose.

148
00:12:25,265 --> 00:12:27,964
But on asphalt we'll be light.

149
00:12:28,965 --> 00:12:31,445
Very light. We'll be flying.

150
00:12:32,446 --> 00:12:35,667
And who's going to drive this
car? Will you drive it, Fiorio?

151
00:12:37,843 --> 00:12:38,843
No.

152
00:12:40,454 --> 00:12:41,673
The best driver will.

153
00:13:14,749 --> 00:13:15,749
Morning.

154
00:13:32,593 --> 00:13:33,593
Walter,

155
00:13:35,335 --> 00:13:36,554
it's Cesare.

156
00:13:36,641 --> 00:13:38,512
Ah, Cesare.

157
00:13:38,643 --> 00:13:40,427
Nice to see you.

158
00:13:40,514 --> 00:13:41,559
Can I take off this?

159
00:13:41,733 --> 00:13:44,170
Take it off, yeah.

160
00:13:44,257 --> 00:13:46,017
Sorry if I didn't tell
you that I was coming,

161
00:13:46,085 --> 00:13:48,783
but you know. What
happened to your face?

162
00:13:48,871 --> 00:13:51,961
Ah, I spent a lifetime
telling people

163
00:13:52,091 --> 00:13:53,223
not to walk in the mountains

164
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,311
with their hand
in their pockets.

165
00:13:54,398 --> 00:13:55,398
And then I.

166
00:13:56,574 --> 00:13:58,489
You did it.

167
00:13:58,576 --> 00:14:00,491
- What are you doing here?
- Nothing.

168
00:14:00,621 --> 00:14:03,581
I, I came to visit
this young pilot.

169
00:14:03,755 --> 00:14:05,975
Very good driver, very talented.

170
00:14:06,105 --> 00:14:07,628
And then I said to myself,

171
00:14:07,715 --> 00:14:09,413
well, I'm very close
to Walter's house,

172
00:14:09,543 --> 00:14:11,894
and why don't you go to
say hello? And here I am,

173
00:14:14,374 --> 00:14:15,374
My bees.

174
00:14:16,594 --> 00:14:18,726
- I see.
- They're strange, huh?

175
00:14:18,813 --> 00:14:22,165
I mean, they're not domesticated
and they're not wild.

176
00:14:22,252 --> 00:14:23,427
They're a mix.

177
00:14:24,602 --> 00:14:27,431
They're creatures capable
of maintaining relationships

178
00:14:27,518 --> 00:14:29,607
with humans without
losing their freedom.

179
00:14:31,478 --> 00:14:32,566
Isn't that wonderful?

180
00:14:33,611 --> 00:14:34,829
Incredible creatures.

181
00:14:37,702 --> 00:14:42,228
So did you, did you sign
up with someone yet?

182
00:14:43,969 --> 00:14:46,319
I've had lots of offers,
I'm weighing them up.

183
00:14:48,582 --> 00:14:51,977
And you, how's the
development coming along?

184
00:14:52,064 --> 00:14:54,240
You've got a competitive
car this year?

185
00:14:54,327 --> 00:14:58,505
Yeah. Special car.
Very incredible car.

186
00:14:58,592 --> 00:15:00,681
Central engine, very powerful,

187
00:15:00,768 --> 00:15:04,598
light car using very
special materials, yeah.

188
00:15:04,729 --> 00:15:05,991
You'll see.

189
00:15:06,078 --> 00:15:07,514
Four wheel drive?

190
00:15:07,601 --> 00:15:09,952
No, no, no, no.
Two wheel drive.

191
00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:12,258
You can't beat them
with a normal car.

192
00:15:12,345 --> 00:15:13,345
Yes we can.

193
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,260
No you can't.

194
00:15:20,614 --> 00:15:21,833
You wanna try the honey?

195
00:15:23,008 --> 00:15:25,750
No. No actually I have to go.

196
00:15:25,837 --> 00:15:28,448
I'm very late, I have to
to drive back to Turin.

197
00:15:30,189 --> 00:15:32,322
- Nice to see you.
- Good to see you.

198
00:15:36,021 --> 00:15:38,806
Cesare, the young
driver, what's his name?

199
00:15:38,893 --> 00:15:40,852
Oh, it's a German name.

200
00:15:40,983 --> 00:15:45,204
I forgot, it's very difficult
name, can't remember. See you.

201
00:15:46,336 --> 00:15:47,336
See you.

202
00:16:02,917 --> 00:16:04,963
What did he want from you?

203
00:16:07,096 --> 00:16:08,880
Guess.

204
00:17:31,267 --> 00:17:33,312
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

205
00:17:33,443 --> 00:17:35,836
May I have a coffee and
some croissants please?

206
00:17:35,923 --> 00:17:37,273
We don't have croissants,

207
00:17:37,447 --> 00:17:39,971
but I can bring you
some bread if you wish.

208
00:17:40,972 --> 00:17:42,626
Okay, some bread. Thanks.

209
00:17:45,672 --> 00:17:48,849
Did you remember the name of the
young driver you came to see?

210
00:17:51,287 --> 00:17:52,984
Yes, of course. Kurt.

211
00:17:56,509 --> 00:17:59,251
Oh. Him, you mean?

212
00:18:02,689 --> 00:18:06,563
Listen Walter, let's be
honest with each other. Hm?

213
00:18:06,737 --> 00:18:10,262
You have to come to try this car.
We can win only if you drive it.

214
00:18:13,352 --> 00:18:16,007
I really don't want to
compete in this championship.

215
00:18:17,617 --> 00:18:19,315
You know what it is, Cesare?

216
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:21,490
I'm tired.

217
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:26,104
Tired of photographers,
hotels, autographs.

218
00:18:26,191 --> 00:18:29,412
I'm tired of winning, but
that's all you care about.

219
00:18:32,284 --> 00:18:35,679
Yeah, it's true. What's
wrong with it? That's my job.

220
00:18:44,992 --> 00:18:47,256
Give me one good reason
why I should accept.

221
00:18:53,827 --> 00:18:55,960
Because we are the underdogs,

222
00:18:56,047 --> 00:19:01,705
and it's perfect if you're
tired of winning, isn't it?

223
00:19:01,792 --> 00:19:06,188
- Are you staying overnight sir?
- No, sir's leaving.

224
00:19:45,139 --> 00:19:46,402
Yes, it's good.

225
00:19:46,489 --> 00:19:48,012
- What is it?
- Zero-forty.

226
00:19:48,186 --> 00:19:50,101
I would try another test

227
00:19:50,188 --> 00:19:52,625
and reduce the tire
pressure to 1.7.

228
00:19:52,843 --> 00:19:55,062
- I'd lighten the clutch a little.
- OK.

229
00:20:02,635 --> 00:20:04,898
Very good, Marco. Well done.

230
00:20:05,551 --> 00:20:07,814
Zero-forty. Excellent time.

231
00:20:08,467 --> 00:20:09,903
Good.

232
00:21:50,917 --> 00:21:53,442
- Does it have a name?
- Yeah.

233
00:21:53,616 --> 00:21:55,705
0' 37" is the new track record.

234
00:21:55,792 --> 00:21:56,793
Nice car.

235
00:21:57,837 --> 00:21:59,012
Do you like it or not?

236
00:22:00,013 --> 00:22:01,667
Powerful engine, light,

237
00:22:02,538 --> 00:22:04,191
great road holding.

238
00:22:04,278 --> 00:22:06,455
Goes exactly where
I want it to go.

239
00:22:06,629 --> 00:22:08,935
I like a shoe made to
measure for my foot, but

240
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:11,850
it's very fragile.

241
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,072
On asphalt, no one will beat it.

242
00:22:16,769 --> 00:22:19,163
On dirt roads and
snow, it's a coffin.

243
00:22:20,338 --> 00:22:21,470
Do you accept or not?

244
00:22:22,775 --> 00:22:26,605
I'll only do the races I love,
Monte Carlo, Acropolis, New Zealand.

245
00:22:26,736 --> 00:22:29,826
Five, six races at the most.

246
00:22:29,913 --> 00:22:31,847
Hey, wait a second. What do
you mean five, six races?

247
00:22:31,871 --> 00:22:35,266
There are 12. I want to win the
whole title, not half of it.

248
00:22:35,353 --> 00:22:38,878
- Six races. Take it or leave it.
- But why?

249
00:22:40,489 --> 00:22:41,577
Take it or leave it.

250
00:22:44,014 --> 00:22:45,537
Well, what did Roöhrl say?

251
00:22:51,195 --> 00:22:53,589
He agreed! He agreed!

252
00:22:54,503 --> 00:22:56,026
Go, Kurt!

253
00:22:59,595 --> 00:23:01,945
Allow me to introduce
the new Lancia 037.

254
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,871
1,996 cubic centimeters
of displacement,

255
00:23:14,958 --> 00:23:17,351
310 horsepower,

256
00:23:17,439 --> 00:23:19,789
volumetric compressor,
rear-wheel drive,

257
00:23:19,876 --> 00:23:21,355
with two-wheel drive.

258
00:23:21,443 --> 00:23:25,011
Mr. Fiorio, to have a
four-wheel drive like the Audi,

259
00:23:25,316 --> 00:23:27,100
you'll need two cars, ja?

260
00:23:27,318 --> 00:23:30,756
Sir, we have a problem.
We don't have enough cars.

261
00:23:31,017 --> 00:23:32,715
Nicolas Muller,
Frankfurter Allgemeine.

262
00:23:36,893 --> 00:23:40,374
As you know, to enter the
world championship, the rule is

263
00:23:40,462 --> 00:23:42,594
that every automaker
has to produce

264
00:23:42,725 --> 00:23:45,597
a minimum of 200 models to
be placed on the market.

265
00:23:45,684 --> 00:23:47,164
So?

266
00:23:47,686 --> 00:23:49,993
Even if we go at full speed
on the production lines

267
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,995
we won't manage
to make them all.

268
00:23:52,082 --> 00:23:53,562
The inspection's tomorrow.

269
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:57,566
- How many do we have?
- 103.

270
00:23:58,654 --> 00:24:00,220
But we need 200.

271
00:24:02,309 --> 00:24:03,876
103.

272
00:24:11,754 --> 00:24:14,278
101, 102.

273
00:24:19,152 --> 00:24:21,024
- How many?
- 103.

274
00:24:21,111 --> 00:24:22,721
- 103?
- Yes.

275
00:24:22,808 --> 00:24:25,332
- Where are the others?
- Eh, this parking lot's full.

276
00:24:25,898 --> 00:24:28,771
They're in another parking lot.

277
00:24:28,988 --> 00:24:31,861
Another parking lot? Let's go,
we have other things to do.

278
00:24:32,078 --> 00:24:34,559
- Let's go, now. All right?
- Yes, let's go, it's nearby.

279
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:36,909
We'll take the car and
go. It's nearby, come.

280
00:24:37,301 --> 00:24:39,042
The usual Italian chaos.

281
00:24:39,129 --> 00:24:40,565
Italians! Always the same.

282
00:24:50,923 --> 00:24:52,795
There's a bit of traffic.

283
00:25:01,847 --> 00:25:05,242
- What now?
- What is it? It's all blocked.

284
00:25:05,459 --> 00:25:07,679
It's blocked. Is the parking
lot still a distance away?

285
00:25:07,766 --> 00:25:11,248
Half an hour. But
I have an idea.

286
00:25:11,335 --> 00:25:14,773
Let's stop. There's a little
restaurant there, we'll stop

287
00:25:14,991 --> 00:25:17,297
and have a quick lunch, then
we'll go to the parking lot.

288
00:25:17,515 --> 00:25:19,691
That way in the meantime...

289
00:25:19,778 --> 00:25:21,867
the traffic will clear a bit.

290
00:25:23,042 --> 00:25:25,523
Yes, but quickly. We
don't have a lot of time!

291
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:27,351
Of course, I promise.

292
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:33,487
So, for starters today we have
agnolotti, very fresh, sir...

293
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,667
Or a nice risotto
with white truffle.

294
00:25:39,537 --> 00:25:41,147
Tomato noodles.

295
00:25:41,757 --> 00:25:43,236
Or we can make a panissa.

296
00:25:43,715 --> 00:25:45,891
Panissa? How do I
translate panissa?

297
00:25:45,978 --> 00:25:47,938
OK, whatever, do a selection,
a bit of everything.

298
00:25:48,154 --> 00:25:49,678
- Red wine?
- Yes, Barolo.

299
00:25:49,895 --> 00:25:51,897
Barolo. Red wine, all right.

300
00:25:52,115 --> 00:25:54,944
- We don't have much time.
- We won't be long.

301
00:25:55,031 --> 00:25:57,337
- I'm going to choose the wine.
- This way, sir.

302
00:25:57,424 --> 00:25:59,339
Right, the Barolos are here.

303
00:25:59,426 --> 00:26:02,081
I'll go to the kitchen, and have
everything prepared very quickly,

304
00:26:02,168 --> 00:26:05,128
- as you wish, quickly.
- No, you need to take your time.

305
00:26:05,215 --> 00:26:06,956
All right? Take your
time. Take your time.

306
00:26:10,568 --> 00:26:12,222
Good.

307
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:22,754
Very good.

308
00:26:24,147 --> 00:26:25,235
Good.

309
00:26:37,464 --> 00:26:39,510
Now we need to go. Shall we go?

310
00:26:39,597 --> 00:26:42,426
- Let's finish eating and go.
- Yes, let's finish and then go.

311
00:26:42,513 --> 00:26:44,602
Alright, take your time.

312
00:26:49,781 --> 00:26:53,002
Finish calmly and then we'll
go. I'm going to the toilet.

313
00:26:57,746 --> 00:27:00,618
95... 96...

314
00:27:01,314 --> 00:27:02,968
And 97.

315
00:27:03,055 --> 00:27:04,970
Plus 103, makes 200.

316
00:27:09,192 --> 00:27:11,063
OK, Fiorio, that's OK.

317
00:27:11,498 --> 00:27:14,676
We have to go, our plane's
waiting. Shall we go?

318
00:27:26,905 --> 00:27:29,255
<i>Welcome to the opening of
the 51st Monte Carlo Rally.</i>

319
00:27:29,473 --> 00:27:33,042
<i>30 special stages of seven
days of 10 transfers.</i>

00:27:33,129 --> 00:27:35,914
<i>Each car arriving late the
time check will be penalized.</i>

321
00:27:39,004 --> 00:27:42,268
<i>Beware they are transferring
from one stage to another</i>

322
00:27:42,355 --> 00:27:45,750
<i>because it's still part of
the race, so let them pass.</i>

Thank you.

339
00:28:47,377 --> 00:28:49,205
- You're welcome.
- The same as the lady.

340
00:28:51,207 --> 00:28:52,556
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

341
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,519
Hi, Cesare.

342
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,176
- Honey, do you know who this is?
- No.

343
00:29:04,263 --> 00:29:05,090
Cesare Fiorio.

344
00:29:05,264 --> 00:29:07,266
He's the team manager of Lancia,

345
00:29:07,353 --> 00:29:09,268
and he's a very brave man.

346
00:29:09,355 --> 00:29:11,618
In fact, he's so brave that
he thinks he can challenge us

347
00:29:11,705 --> 00:29:14,491
without a four-wheel drive.

348
00:29:14,578 --> 00:29:18,712
- Slow and steady wins the race
- Four are better than two.

349
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:21,367
Don't you feel cold?

350
00:29:21,454 --> 00:29:22,978
No, I'm used to it.

351
00:29:23,848 --> 00:29:25,545
By the way, I
checked the weather.

352
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:27,112
It's going to snow tomorrow.

353
00:29:27,199 --> 00:29:28,679
So don't forget
your snow chains.

354
00:29:28,766 --> 00:29:30,072
- Champagne, please.
- Yes.

355
00:29:33,336 --> 00:29:35,033
Tastes better with
ice, don't you think?

356
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:38,167
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

357
00:29:47,176 --> 00:29:48,568
Thank you.

358
00:30:31,133 --> 00:30:33,831
- Is that salt?
- Yes, it's salt.

359
00:30:36,486 --> 00:30:39,315
- Is this OK?
- Yes, sir.

360
00:30:39,837 --> 00:30:41,447
Go, go!

361
00:30:45,799 --> 00:30:46,844
Go, come on.

362
00:30:49,064 --> 00:30:51,544
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

363
00:30:53,155 --> 00:30:54,808
I imagine you're very busy,

364
00:30:55,026 --> 00:30:57,594
but honestly it's
really dangerous.

365
00:30:58,421 --> 00:31:01,815
I was driving, and
there's ice, snow...

366
00:31:02,294 --> 00:31:04,993
You can't drive on it. Can
you do something, please?

367
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:07,952
Yes, I totally
understand the situation.

368
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:10,650
Give me a minute and I'll
deal with it right away.

369
00:31:11,869 --> 00:31:13,175
Thank you.

370
00:31:37,939 --> 00:31:41,029
Hey, guys! There's a
lot of ice up there.

371
00:31:41,246 --> 00:31:43,640
Let's put the
studded tires on, go!

372
00:31:59,786 --> 00:32:01,527
- We'll put them on as well.
- OK.

373
00:32:11,929 --> 00:32:13,844
<i>And here is Walter Roöhrl,</i>

374
00:32:13,931 --> 00:32:16,238
<i>Prince of Monte Carlo and
reigning world champion,</i>

375
00:32:16,325 --> 00:32:19,632
<i>driving the Lancia 037.</i>

376
00:32:19,719 --> 00:32:22,853
<i>Great favorite this year on
the four wheel drive Audi,</i>

377
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:25,464
<i>Hannu Mikkola, the Flying Finn.</i>

378
00:32:25,551 --> 00:32:27,031
<i>But the fabulous Porsche.</i>

379
00:32:27,205 --> 00:32:30,382
<i>This is not Formula
one, this is rally.</i>

380
00:32:30,556 --> 00:32:35,083
<i>Winner in 1978 in the legendary
Lancia Stratos, Markku Alén.</i>

381
00:33:36,405 --> 00:33:38,885
They are changing
the studded tires.

382
00:33:38,972 --> 00:33:42,541
I repeat, they are
changing the studded tires.

383
00:33:43,151 --> 00:33:44,369
Shit!

384
00:33:44,587 --> 00:33:45,979
The noodle munchers tricked us!

385
00:34:48,955 --> 00:34:53,308
Nice idea that, changing the
tires and removing the snow.

386
00:34:53,395 --> 00:34:54,744
I didn't think about that.

387
00:34:55,962 --> 00:34:58,487
Do you have any other ideas for
the rest of the championship?

388
00:34:59,401 --> 00:35:03,666
Well, I'll do whatever the
regulations allow me to do.

389
00:35:03,753 --> 00:35:06,756
- Because you read them?
- Yes, of course.

390
00:35:06,843 --> 00:35:09,933
You should know them better
than me because you wrote them.

391
00:35:13,676 --> 00:35:14,981
What do you insinuate?

392
00:35:15,982 --> 00:35:18,289
No, I will never allow
myself to insinuate anything.

393
00:35:18,376 --> 00:35:20,378
But it's curious that
when you would just ready

394
00:35:20,552 --> 00:35:21,727
with four-wheel drive,

395
00:35:23,381 --> 00:35:26,602
a footnote was inserted
in regulations book

396
00:35:26,689 --> 00:35:29,692
that opened world championship
up to four-wheel drives.

397
00:35:30,823 --> 00:35:33,957
But of course, that's
just a coincidence, right?

398
00:35:34,131 --> 00:35:35,131
Sure.

399
00:35:36,699 --> 00:35:38,048
Like the salt on the roads.

400
00:35:39,267 --> 00:35:40,267
- Exactly.
- Hmm.

401
00:35:42,487 --> 00:35:44,837
Congratulations on
your elegance, Cesare.

402
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:48,276
Congratulations
on your precision.

403
00:35:54,847 --> 00:35:57,067
Mr. Fiorio, there's a problem.

404
00:35:57,154 --> 00:35:59,591
We can't formalize
the victory yet.

405
00:36:00,331 --> 00:36:02,768
What? What are we
supposed to do?

406
00:36:02,986 --> 00:36:05,075
Put the corks back
in the champagne?

407
00:36:05,162 --> 00:36:07,643
No, Fiorio. We're not joking.

408
00:36:08,078 --> 00:36:10,820
Audi objected,

409
00:36:10,907 --> 00:36:14,302
and at the very least we have
to evaluate it, you understand?

410
00:36:15,128 --> 00:36:19,481
They claimed there was a
violation of the regulations.

411
00:36:19,568 --> 00:36:21,091
You know how it works.

412
00:36:21,178 --> 00:36:24,094
There's a disqualification
for this. That's how it is.

413
00:36:24,529 --> 00:36:26,749
A violation? What are
you talking about?

414
00:36:26,836 --> 00:36:28,359
This is a joke.

415
00:36:28,446 --> 00:36:31,536
There was absolutely
no violation.

416
00:36:31,623 --> 00:36:34,757
You exploited your relationship
with the authorities,

417
00:36:34,844 --> 00:36:38,151
you had salt put on the road
and had the ice removed.

418
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:41,154
- That's a violation, Fiorio.
- No, it's not.

419
00:36:41,242 --> 00:36:44,027
These are the regulations.
I know them by heart.

420
00:36:44,114 --> 00:36:46,943
All right? Check for yourself.

421
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:49,685
It's not written anywhere.

422
00:36:50,076 --> 00:36:52,122
It's not allowed,

423
00:36:52,209 --> 00:36:54,211
but neither is it forbidden.

424
00:36:54,385 --> 00:36:55,821
On you go, check.

425
00:36:56,735 --> 00:36:58,346
Mr. Fiorio,

426
00:36:58,563 --> 00:37:01,523
could you wait outside
for a moment, please?

427
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:21,804
He's right. If it's not
forbidden, it's allowed.

428
00:37:23,196 --> 00:37:24,372
All right, let's sign this.

429
00:37:27,331 --> 00:37:28,419
Come in.

430
00:37:31,204 --> 00:37:32,380
There!

431
00:37:33,424 --> 00:37:35,252
- The victory certificate.
- Thank you.

432
00:37:38,168 --> 00:37:40,039
What else do you
want, Fiorio? Eh?

433
00:37:40,126 --> 00:37:41,954
Do you have any aspirin?
I have a headache.

434
00:37:43,956 --> 00:37:46,698
It's OK, sorry. Thank you.

435
00:37:52,965 --> 00:37:54,227
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

436
00:37:54,402 --> 00:37:57,970
Mr. Fiorio, Lancia team manager.

437
00:37:58,057 --> 00:38:02,192
I'm sorry, Fiorio. I'm sorry,
I cannot find you on the list.

438
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:06,065
If you search my name in the standings,
you'll find it in the first place.

439
00:38:06,152 --> 00:38:07,284
In this list, I don't know.

440
00:38:07,458 --> 00:38:09,199
The dress code is
jacket and tie.

441
00:38:09,286 --> 00:38:11,027
Maybe we can find you jacket.

442
00:38:24,562 --> 00:38:26,999
Are you feeling all right?

443
00:38:27,086 --> 00:38:29,132
You don't, you
don't look so great.

444
00:38:29,262 --> 00:38:32,527
Thanks. I think I
have a temperature.

445
00:38:33,354 --> 00:38:36,400
- Have you taken anything?
- An aspirin.

446
00:38:37,488 --> 00:38:40,578
Ask them for a grog. Hot
rum, honey and lemon.

447
00:38:42,145 --> 00:38:43,233
Take my advice.

448
00:40:08,318 --> 00:40:09,318
Hi.

449
00:40:10,015 --> 00:40:11,452
- Hmm.
- See?

450
00:40:11,539 --> 00:40:13,323
- Are you feeling better?
- Yeah.

451
00:40:13,497 --> 00:40:14,498
What'd I tell you?

452
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:18,284
By the way, I'm Cesare.
Nice to meet you.

453
00:40:18,459 --> 00:40:19,895
Fiorio, I know.

454
00:40:20,896 --> 00:40:22,811
Is there anyone here
who doesn't know you?

455
00:40:23,159 --> 00:40:25,279
Actually, the people at the
front door, but nevermind.

456
00:40:25,335 --> 00:40:28,469
I mean, what are you
doing here in this circus?

457
00:40:28,599 --> 00:40:29,599
Getting bored.

458
00:40:31,167 --> 00:40:33,082
Well, in that case,
you should go home.

459
00:40:33,169 --> 00:40:36,738
- Yeah.
- But what do you do in life?

460
00:40:36,825 --> 00:40:38,391
I teach nutritional medicine

461
00:40:38,479 --> 00:40:40,089
at the University of Grenoble.

462
00:40:50,403 --> 00:40:52,275
Shall we have a toast?

463
00:40:53,842 --> 00:40:55,452
- Well, did we really win?
- Yes.

464
00:40:55,626 --> 00:40:56,671
Finally we win.

465
00:40:56,932 --> 00:40:58,716
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

466
00:40:59,412 --> 00:41:03,504
I mean, it went well this
time, but you know, in Sweden,

467
00:41:04,635 --> 00:41:06,681
I need you even more so.

468
00:41:06,768 --> 00:41:08,421
Well, I'm not coming to Sweden.

469
00:41:10,989 --> 00:41:13,949
Listen, I know you don't
care about, you know,

470
00:41:14,036 --> 00:41:15,516
the driver's championship,

471
00:41:16,517 --> 00:41:17,996
but I have to win.

472
00:41:18,083 --> 00:41:19,483
I have to win the
constructors' one.

473
00:41:19,563 --> 00:41:20,923
You understand
that? Is that clear?

474
00:41:21,043 --> 00:41:22,610
That's your problem, not mine.

475
00:41:24,481 --> 00:41:25,481
I told you that.

476
00:41:33,011 --> 00:41:34,796
Excuse me for a moment,
I'll call you back.

477
00:41:37,494 --> 00:41:39,148
Walter...

478
00:41:39,235 --> 00:41:41,280
is refusing to go to Sweden.

479
00:41:41,498 --> 00:41:44,457
What do you mean, refusing? It's
not like it's a company outing.

480
00:41:44,719 --> 00:41:46,634
Don't ask me to explain,
it's complicated.

481
00:41:46,764 --> 00:41:48,897
Don't ask me to convince
him. It's impossible.

482
00:41:48,984 --> 00:41:50,202
You asked for him.

483
00:41:52,553 --> 00:41:56,121
I was thinking... we could
simply not go to Sweden.

484
00:41:56,339 --> 00:41:58,471
What do you mean,
not go to Sweden?

485
00:41:58,559 --> 00:42:00,822
Let's pass this whim of
Walter's off as a team choice.

486
00:42:01,083 --> 00:42:03,520
If he wants to stay home to make
honey, we have other drivers.

487
00:42:03,738 --> 00:42:06,305
You know fine we can't win
in the snow without him.

488
00:42:06,523 --> 00:42:08,873
If we stay home, the
Germans will get a fright.

489
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,745
Lancia is so strong

490
00:42:10,832 --> 00:42:12,311
they can afford to skip a round.

491
00:42:12,529 --> 00:42:14,096
- So are we withdrawing?
- No.

492
00:42:14,313 --> 00:42:17,534
We're not withdrawing. We're just
moving in a different direction.

493
00:42:17,752 --> 00:42:19,710
I've heard bullshit
before, but this really...

494
00:42:19,928 --> 00:42:22,191
Not going to Sweden will
result in huge savings.

495
00:42:22,278 --> 00:42:23,671
Do you know what
this circus costs?

496
00:42:23,888 --> 00:42:26,543
Helicopters, planes,
trucks. 40 people to move.

497
00:42:26,804 --> 00:42:29,415
With that money we
could develop the 037.

498
00:42:30,895 --> 00:42:32,331
And win in Portugal.

499
00:42:33,768 --> 00:42:35,857
You take the
responsibility for this.

500
00:42:35,944 --> 00:42:37,206
But if it goes wrong...

501
00:42:37,423 --> 00:42:38,860
But what if it goes well?

502
00:43:12,589 --> 00:43:14,243
<i>With this victory</i>

503
00:43:14,373 --> 00:43:16,462
<i>you're sending a clear
signal to your rivals.</i>

504
00:43:16,593 --> 00:43:18,793
<i>Even if Lancia didn't show
up, are you the team to beat?</i>

505
00:43:19,117 --> 00:43:22,164
Don't worry, sir,
we'll win in Portugal.

506
00:43:22,251 --> 00:43:23,644
The road ahead is very long,

507
00:43:23,731 --> 00:43:25,646
so it's too soon to
make any predictions.

508
00:43:25,776 --> 00:43:28,126
Our rivals are more than
worthy of respect, thanks.

509
00:43:28,213 --> 00:43:31,913
<i>Are you referring to
anyone in particular?</i>

510
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,001
No.

511
00:43:37,353 --> 00:43:39,747
<i>The wait is over. Here
we are, once again,</i>

512
00:43:39,834 --> 00:43:43,968
<i>with the protagonists of
the 17th rally of Porto.</i>

513
00:43:45,578 --> 00:43:47,624
<i>Walter Roöhrl's Lancia.</i>

514
00:43:47,711 --> 00:43:49,713
<i>Wait, maybe there's
a problem for Roöhrl.</i>

515
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:53,674
Welcome back, Walter.

516
00:43:54,936 --> 00:43:56,502
Come on.

517
00:43:56,589 --> 00:43:58,026
<i>Well, back on course.</i>

518
00:44:13,389 --> 00:44:14,999
Roger.

519
00:44:43,985 --> 00:44:45,073
10 seconds.

520
00:44:52,036 --> 00:44:53,036
Go!

521
00:45:04,048 --> 00:45:05,528
Go!

522
00:45:43,566 --> 00:45:44,566
Fantastic.

523
00:45:49,572 --> 00:45:51,313
As you were saying,

524
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:53,881
Audi has invested heavily to
become competitive in rallying,

525
00:45:53,968 --> 00:45:57,972
and this year they're demonstrating
all their technical strength.

526
00:45:59,277 --> 00:46:01,192
Yeah, but you know,

527
00:46:01,279 --> 00:46:04,717
money and technology are not
enough to win in this sport.

528
00:46:04,805 --> 00:46:06,850
So what do you need to win?

529
00:46:07,764 --> 00:46:10,288
Heart and brain and a
pinch of creativity.

530
00:46:10,375 --> 00:46:14,075
- Ah, talent.
- Hmm, I would say obsession.

531
00:46:14,945 --> 00:46:16,465
Looking at the
constructors' standings,

532
00:46:16,512 --> 00:46:18,122
Audi is ahead of Lancia.

533
00:46:18,209 --> 00:46:21,734
So it doesn't seem
to me that this

534
00:46:21,822 --> 00:46:25,086
obsession is giving you the
results that you wanted.

535
00:46:25,173 --> 00:46:27,915
And yet you're still
fighting your partisan war.

536
00:46:28,002 --> 00:46:33,442
In this business you're very
well known for being creative

537
00:46:33,572 --> 00:46:36,619
and finding solutions
to help you win.

538
00:46:37,489 --> 00:46:38,926
Who says that?

539
00:46:39,535 --> 00:46:43,017
Listen, this is a sport
that's raced on the road.

540
00:46:43,191 --> 00:46:45,671
And on the road, anything goes.

541
00:46:45,758 --> 00:46:47,804
You've dominated the
industry for two decades.

542
00:46:47,978 --> 00:46:51,634
In 1963, you founded
the High Fidelity team.

543
00:46:52,983 --> 00:46:57,031
Do you still feel that you
can ensure this High Fidelity

544
00:46:57,118 --> 00:46:59,598
to the company, to the team?

545
00:47:04,081 --> 00:47:05,474
Yes, I can.

546
00:47:08,172 --> 00:47:10,044
You're being very selfish.

547
00:47:10,218 --> 00:47:14,309
It was a very hot day.
What did you expect?

548
00:47:14,483 --> 00:47:15,919
I like you.

549
00:47:16,093 --> 00:47:17,965
This is my profession.
This is who I am.

550
00:47:18,139 --> 00:47:20,204
You want me in southern France,
drinking rose all the time.

551
00:47:20,228 --> 00:47:21,359
No, no, no.

552
00:47:21,446 --> 00:47:22,641
But this your permanent record,

553
00:47:22,665 --> 00:47:24,058
but you've never been happy.

554
00:47:24,145 --> 00:47:25,505
And I don't want
to live like this.

555
00:47:25,581 --> 00:47:27,235
Sorry Roland, I'm tired.

556
00:47:29,237 --> 00:47:31,456
Yo, stay here, Gloria.

557
00:47:49,431 --> 00:47:50,431
Are you okay?

558
00:47:51,955 --> 00:47:53,957
Yeah.

559
00:47:54,044 --> 00:47:54,784
Sure?

560
00:47:54,871 --> 00:47:56,177
Yes, sure.

561
00:47:58,222 --> 00:47:59,745
Why are you asking?

562
00:47:59,832 --> 00:48:02,618
We are having a
party because we won.

563
00:48:03,967 --> 00:48:05,490
You still think that the Germans

564
00:48:05,621 --> 00:48:07,536
are only technology and
organization, don't you?

565
00:48:10,669 --> 00:48:13,150
But don't believe all
the cliches, Fiorio.

566
00:48:13,237 --> 00:48:17,024
Because with that car, you
will never win against me.

567
00:48:19,983 --> 00:48:20,983
Another round?

568
00:48:22,725 --> 00:48:24,466
Cheers!

569
00:48:24,945 --> 00:48:28,165
Mr. Fiorio? We are ready.

570
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:31,038
Okay, let's go.

571
00:48:31,125 --> 00:48:33,779
This year to award
the prize to Udo Kurt,

572
00:48:33,866 --> 00:48:36,826
the young driver who stood out
in the Stewart McCoy Memorial,

573
00:48:36,913 --> 00:48:39,568
ladies and gentlemen,
Cesare Fiorio.

574
00:48:42,963 --> 00:48:45,443
We have also here tonight,
the daughter of the driver

575
00:48:45,530 --> 00:48:48,055
who left us 20 years ago
in a tragic accident.

576
00:48:48,142 --> 00:48:49,982
Ladies and gentlemen, I
ask a round of applause

577
00:48:50,057 --> 00:48:53,886
to the beautiful Jane, daughter
of the great Stuart McCoy!

578
00:48:59,675 --> 00:49:04,158
Now we can finally give to
the young driver the award.

579
00:49:05,724 --> 00:49:06,724
Wow.

580
00:49:08,162 --> 00:49:09,162
Thank you.

581
00:49:10,729 --> 00:49:15,125
I, I'm very delighted to be
here. It's an honor for me.

582
00:49:16,039 --> 00:49:19,042
When I started to
sign with Lancia,

583
00:49:19,216 --> 00:49:21,044
it was like a dream come true

584
00:49:22,524 --> 00:49:23,964
and an emotion that
is indescribable,

585
00:49:24,091 --> 00:49:25,396
so thank you very much.

586
00:49:27,529 --> 00:49:28,921
So, we meet again.

587
00:49:30,184 --> 00:49:32,882
It's not that surprising, seeing
as we're on the same road.

588
00:49:34,579 --> 00:49:35,624
I knew your father.

589
00:49:37,365 --> 00:49:41,499
Yeah, it seems like everyone
did, and better than me.

590
00:49:42,848 --> 00:49:44,633
I was too young
when it happened.

591
00:49:44,763 --> 00:49:46,983
I remember exactly where I
was the day of the accident.

592
00:49:47,070 --> 00:49:48,724
I don't wanna talk about it.

593
00:49:50,987 --> 00:49:54,599
So, what are you doing here?
Getting bored here, too?

594
00:49:56,775 --> 00:49:58,081
Listen, I was thinking,

595
00:49:59,082 --> 00:50:02,216
I mean, I really need
a doctor on my team.

596
00:50:02,390 --> 00:50:04,110
I need someone who takes
care of my drivers.

597
00:50:04,174 --> 00:50:07,308
You know, diets,
physical conditions.

598
00:50:07,395 --> 00:50:09,832
I think you are
the right person.

599
00:50:09,962 --> 00:50:13,183
Look, I've spent my entire life trying
to keep my distance from racing.

600
00:50:14,315 --> 00:50:16,186
I don't think it's a good idea.

601
00:50:16,273 --> 00:50:20,103
I think it could be good
for you, if you join us, hm?

602
00:50:20,190 --> 00:50:21,887
Also to fight boredom.

603
00:50:32,594 --> 00:50:36,293
6:00 PM L'AVVOCATO CALLED

604
00:51:14,549 --> 00:51:16,551
- Sir.
- What are you doing?

605
00:51:16,768 --> 00:51:19,336
I understand how the
Audi's exhaust works.

606
00:51:21,121 --> 00:51:23,688
They're made of titanium.
I mean, on a sedan...

607
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:26,126
so they have a long
car, long exhaust.

608
00:51:26,213 --> 00:51:27,997
So, they've lightened it.

609
00:51:28,084 --> 00:51:31,000
If we could mount the same
exhaust, we'd go faster.

610
00:51:33,350 --> 00:51:35,470
Are you an engineer? A
designer? Do you have a degree?

611
00:51:35,570 --> 00:51:37,572
- No, I thought...
- There, you mustn't think.

612
00:51:37,702 --> 00:51:39,139
You mustn't think.

613
00:51:39,356 --> 00:51:41,663
- It was about looking bad in Portugal.
- I heard you.

614
00:51:42,316 --> 00:51:45,493
I looked like shit, not you.
It's me who looks like shit.

615
00:51:55,155 --> 00:51:57,505
<i>A brand like Fiat Lancia
cannot afford this look.</i>

616
00:51:58,419 --> 00:52:01,335
<i>After these defeats, the last of
which I'd say was a humiliation,</i>

617
00:52:01,422 --> 00:52:06,253
<i>the sponsors are starting
to threaten to pull out.</i>

618
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:08,690
<i>Justifying all this
money without any results</i>

619
00:52:08,777 --> 00:52:10,735
<i>isn't what you promised me.</i>

620
00:52:10,996 --> 00:52:12,998
<i>Remember that if you go, I go.</i>

621
00:52:13,085 --> 00:52:15,479
<i>So find some way to
start winning again...</i>

622
00:52:15,566 --> 00:52:17,786
- Yes.
- <i>If you're still able.</i>

623
00:52:17,873 --> 00:52:20,136
Don't worry, I'll find
a way, you'll see.

624
00:52:27,926 --> 00:52:30,015
<i>The revenge finally comes</i>

625
00:52:30,102 --> 00:52:32,583
<i>for Cesare Fiorio
and his Lancia.</i>

626
00:52:32,714 --> 00:52:36,065
<i>After two consecutive
defeats, they win in Corsica.</i>

627
00:52:36,152 --> 00:52:38,894
<i>Mikkola's Audi was
soundly beaten.</i>

628
00:52:38,981 --> 00:52:41,766
<i>The world championship
is thus reopened.</i>

629
00:52:43,725 --> 00:52:45,292
We're two minutes ahead.

630
00:52:45,379 --> 00:52:47,642
We drove well and made
the right choices.

631
00:52:50,688 --> 00:52:52,212
Hello, Mikkola.

632
00:52:52,299 --> 00:52:53,450
How do you feel being
in second place?

633
00:52:53,474 --> 00:52:55,084
Not good.

634
00:52:55,215 --> 00:52:58,609
Not good. We are late
by about two minutes.

635
00:53:05,747 --> 00:53:09,011
Do you think Audi will
be able to recover?

636
00:53:09,098 --> 00:53:10,098
No.

637
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:12,144
You finished?

638
00:53:15,583 --> 00:53:17,149
<i>The solutions</i> adopted by Fiorio

639
00:53:17,324 --> 00:53:19,674
<i>has begun to yield results.</i>

640
00:53:19,804 --> 00:53:23,199
<i>Rumor has it they've managed
to lighten their exhaust.</i>

641
00:53:23,330 --> 00:53:25,854

642
00:53:25,941 --> 00:53:27,508

643
00:53:39,389 --> 00:53:41,217
Telegram from L'Avvocato.

644
00:53:42,305 --> 00:53:43,654
What happened here?

645
00:53:44,394 --> 00:53:46,701
They were celebrating,
they had too much to drink.

646
00:53:46,788 --> 00:53:49,181
No, they don't even have
the strength to drink.

647
00:53:49,269 --> 00:53:51,401
Do they know you won?
It's like you lost.

648
00:53:52,097 --> 00:53:55,492
L'Avvocato congratulates you. He
wants the same again in Greece.

649
00:53:57,755 --> 00:53:59,975
We need to see if they
can make it to Greece.

650
00:54:00,062 --> 00:54:01,542
What d'you mean?

651
00:54:01,890 --> 00:54:05,415
I mean they're physically
broken, they're done in.

652
00:54:05,502 --> 00:54:07,287
We need to do something.

653
00:54:08,592 --> 00:54:10,638
Listen, wait a minute for me.

654
00:54:14,206 --> 00:54:15,773
Hello?

655
00:54:15,860 --> 00:54:17,862
Yes, can I speak with
Dr. McCoy please?

656
00:54:19,516 --> 00:54:23,128
Jane, it's Cesare,
Cesare Fiorio.

657
00:54:23,259 --> 00:54:24,259
You remember me?

658
00:54:27,307 --> 00:54:28,307
Guys,

659
00:54:33,269 --> 00:54:35,532
may I have your
attention please?

660
00:54:35,663 --> 00:54:37,534
May I introduce to
you Dr. Jane McCoy.

661
00:54:37,708 --> 00:54:42,234
She teaches nutritional science
at University of Bordeaux.

662
00:54:42,322 --> 00:54:44,715
- Grenoble.
- Ah Grenoble, sorry.

663
00:54:44,802 --> 00:54:47,196
- Good morning, everyone.
- Morning.

664
00:54:47,283 --> 00:54:50,286
So from now on she will tell you
what to eat and what to drink.

665
00:54:50,373 --> 00:54:52,288
More than anything else,

666
00:54:52,419 --> 00:54:54,725
I'll be telling you what not
to eat and what not to drink.

667
00:54:54,812 --> 00:54:56,379
She will also tell you

668
00:54:56,466 --> 00:54:58,163
what time to go to
sleep, unfortunately.

669
00:54:58,338 --> 00:55:02,037
Each of you will be examined
and have a personalized report.

670
00:55:02,124 --> 00:55:04,996
I'll follow each of you
checking your biorhythms,

671
00:55:05,083 --> 00:55:08,565
calculating your calorie
intake and vitamin needs.

672
00:55:08,652 --> 00:55:11,742
As we know, we can't
afford any more mishaps.

673
00:55:11,829 --> 00:55:16,791
The drivers have to always be
in peak physical condition.

674
00:55:16,878 --> 00:55:17,878
Any questions?

675
00:55:20,185 --> 00:55:21,970
Good, good.

676
00:55:22,057 --> 00:55:23,406
Let's get to work, come on.

677
00:55:41,511 --> 00:55:44,862
So this is where we're gonna
have the first service, okay?

678
00:55:44,949 --> 00:55:46,429
Then the second and the third.

679
00:55:46,603 --> 00:55:48,953
After this, we're gonna
have a long section,

680
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:50,955
road section, okay?

681
00:55:51,042 --> 00:55:53,697
To reach this point after two
hours for the stop control.

682
00:55:56,352 --> 00:55:59,137
And then we need to be in
Athens at nine, at the hotel.

683
00:55:59,311 --> 00:56:02,489
You need to be there too,
to check the drivers over.

684
00:56:02,663 --> 00:56:03,663
Yeah, sounds good.

685
00:56:08,233 --> 00:56:09,233
Cesare,

686
00:56:09,974 --> 00:56:11,193
you okay?

687
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:13,195
Yeah, I'm just thinking

688
00:56:14,631 --> 00:56:15,631
About what?

689
00:56:17,155 --> 00:56:18,418
Winning.

690
00:56:40,657 --> 00:56:41,702
What are you doing?

691
00:56:44,444 --> 00:56:45,706
Wait for me here.

692
00:56:53,104 --> 00:56:55,019
Are you crazy?

693
00:56:55,106 --> 00:56:57,306
We have to be at, the stop
control in less than an hour.

694
00:56:57,805 --> 00:57:00,111
Precisely. In one hour.

695
00:57:00,285 --> 00:57:01,285
Relax.

696
00:57:05,334 --> 00:57:07,031
- Hello.
- Hello.

697
00:57:11,732 --> 00:57:13,690
- Honey.
- Is yours?

698
00:57:13,777 --> 00:57:14,777
Greek honey.

699
00:57:18,739 --> 00:57:20,392
Smell this...

700
00:57:31,229 --> 00:57:32,229
And, um.

701
00:57:33,797 --> 00:57:36,713
I'll do it.

702
00:57:44,982 --> 00:57:46,288
What, what material?

703
00:57:46,375 --> 00:57:47,855
There is no time, Walter.

704
00:57:47,985 --> 00:57:49,117
The other cars are coming.

705
00:57:49,204 --> 00:57:50,335
Yes, okay, okay.

706
00:57:50,422 --> 00:57:51,772
Otherwise we'll be penalized.

707
00:57:51,859 --> 00:57:53,643
Don't be rude. I'll
be right there.

708
00:57:53,730 --> 00:57:56,080
Elena, bring some honey.

709
00:57:56,167 --> 00:57:59,780
Okay, I, I.

710
00:58:10,486 --> 00:58:12,053
Thank you.

711
00:58:46,914 --> 00:58:48,393
Get away, get away.

712
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:49,917
Hurry up.

713
00:58:50,004 --> 00:58:51,701
Hurry up guys, get
away from here.

714
00:58:52,789 --> 00:58:53,834
Hurry up please hurry up.

715
00:58:55,009 --> 00:58:56,314
It's a fucking race rally.

716
00:58:56,488 --> 00:58:57,489
Get out of the way.

717
00:59:00,014 --> 00:59:00,928
No, no, wait, wait.

718
00:59:01,015 --> 00:59:02,016
We are gonna be.

719
00:59:02,103 --> 00:59:03,539
What are you doing?

720
00:59:03,713 --> 00:59:06,760
This prick doesn't go
away with these sheep.

721
00:59:09,719 --> 00:59:10,851
Greece.

722
00:59:16,465 --> 00:59:18,206
What, what's happening now?

723
00:59:23,428 --> 00:59:24,428
What is happening?

724
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:25,560
It's dead.

725
00:59:25,605 --> 00:59:26,605
Okay, let me see.

726
00:59:28,346 --> 00:59:30,827
Maybe it's an
electrical problem.

727
00:59:30,914 --> 00:59:31,914
Come on, try again.

728
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:34,570
No, nothing, nothing.

729
00:59:34,657 --> 00:59:36,311
Okay, give it a try.

730
00:59:37,399 --> 00:59:38,400
Yeah.

731
00:59:38,487 --> 00:59:40,445
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

732
00:59:41,708 --> 00:59:43,448
- Okay, go.
- Go, go.

733
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,480
This is base, communicate
your position, please.

734
01:00:16,264 --> 01:00:17,178
Walter?

735
01:00:17,265 --> 01:00:18,440
What is he doing?

736
01:00:18,527 --> 01:00:19,635
We are in transfer not a race.

737
01:00:19,659 --> 01:00:21,138
He wants to keep us back

738
01:00:21,269 --> 01:00:22,463
so we arrive late
for the time check.

739
01:00:22,487 --> 01:00:23,750
He wants us to get the penalty?

740
01:00:23,924 --> 01:00:25,882
We'll be seeing if he succeeds.

741
01:00:27,579 --> 01:00:28,687
Walter, this is base,
can you hear me?

742
01:00:28,711 --> 01:00:29,756
Walter, where are you?

743
01:00:29,886 --> 01:00:31,366
On our way, we're coming.

744
01:00:46,729 --> 01:00:51,168
Are you crazy? You'll
get a puncture this way.

745
01:01:51,272 --> 01:01:52,926
Okay, here you go.

746
01:02:14,861 --> 01:02:18,516
Walter, I mean,
where have you been?

747
01:02:18,603 --> 01:02:20,388
I tried to call
you on the radio.

748
01:02:20,562 --> 01:02:22,477
Well done. Good job.

749
01:02:31,703 --> 01:02:32,703
What did he say?

750
01:02:33,705 --> 01:02:34,705
Nevermind.

751
01:02:36,970 --> 01:02:39,799
Listen Udo, in Finland
you really fly.

752
01:02:39,886 --> 01:02:41,801
The brake's more
important than the gas.

753
01:02:41,888 --> 01:02:43,715
The way you control
the oversteer.

754
01:02:44,586 --> 01:02:46,457
Walter, why are you
telling me this?

755
01:02:47,589 --> 01:02:48,982
You want me to win the race?

756
01:02:50,810 --> 01:02:52,507
I want you to get to the finish.

757
01:02:53,769 --> 01:02:54,769
Take care.

758
01:02:54,814 --> 01:02:55,814
You too.

759
01:02:59,514 --> 01:03:00,514
Walter,

760
01:03:07,957 --> 01:03:09,567
what did you say to Kurt?

761
01:03:09,698 --> 01:03:11,656
I was wishing him
luck for Finland.

762
01:03:11,743 --> 01:03:13,833
- Why?
- Because I like him.

763
01:03:15,791 --> 01:03:17,053
What do you mean you like him?

764
01:03:18,838 --> 01:03:21,188
I like him, He's a nice
guy. I wish him luck.

765
01:03:21,275 --> 01:03:23,059
What's the problem?

766
01:03:23,146 --> 01:03:26,541
Are you gonna come
to Finland or not?

767
01:03:26,715 --> 01:03:28,195
No.

768
01:03:28,282 --> 01:03:29,892
No, you are coming.

769
01:03:29,979 --> 01:03:31,522
- No, I'm not.
- And don't say I told you.

770
01:03:31,546 --> 01:03:33,219
But I did tell you,
that was the agreement.

771
01:03:33,243 --> 01:03:34,742
What are you talking
about? What agreement?

772
01:03:34,766 --> 01:03:36,266
Listen, why don't you
see that doing this

773
01:03:36,290 --> 01:03:38,161
you're dropping the
whole team in the shit,

774
01:03:38,248 --> 01:03:40,076
and handing the title to Audi.

775
01:03:40,250 --> 01:03:41,773
Only losers always want to win.

776
01:03:41,948 --> 01:03:43,906
Bullshit, come on man, bullshit.

777
01:03:43,993 --> 01:03:45,603
You know what I think?

778
01:03:45,734 --> 01:03:47,454
I think that you don't
want to come because,

779
01:03:48,563 --> 01:03:50,434
because you're scared.

780
01:03:50,521 --> 01:03:52,306
- Hmm?
- I'm scared.

781
01:03:52,393 --> 01:03:53,393
Yes.

782
01:03:55,004 --> 01:03:56,004
Yes.

783
01:03:56,832 --> 01:03:59,052
It's possible, maybe yes.

784
01:03:59,139 --> 01:04:01,141
You know what the problem is?

785
01:04:01,271 --> 01:04:03,012
It's you not being
scared enough,

786
01:04:04,971 --> 01:04:06,973
because that car
isn't made for jumps.

787
01:04:07,060 --> 01:04:09,671
You've lightened it too
much, you should know that.

788
01:04:09,758 --> 01:04:11,194
You knew it before.

789
01:04:11,281 --> 01:04:12,630
- Yes I did.
- You knew it before.

790
01:04:12,717 --> 01:04:13,414
- I told you.
- Now we have a problem.

791
01:04:13,544 --> 01:04:14,371
What do you do?

792
01:04:14,545 --> 01:04:15,982
You're going away.

793
01:04:16,112 --> 01:04:17,133
You let me down.
You leave me alone.

794
01:04:17,157 --> 01:04:18,636
You know, okay okay, go.

795
01:04:18,767 --> 01:04:21,161
Okay, fuck you
Walter. Fuck you.

796
01:04:22,510 --> 01:04:23,510
You're fired.

797
01:04:24,468 --> 01:04:26,035
You're fired. Go go.

798
01:04:40,267 --> 01:04:42,138
You won't race, you're
not strong enough.

799
01:04:42,225 --> 01:04:46,012
- I'm going to win in Finland.
- No, it's not the point.

800
01:04:48,797 --> 01:04:51,365
Look, when we get to Turin,
I will examine you properly

801
01:04:51,452 --> 01:04:54,411
and if there's even 1%
chance that you can race,

802
01:04:54,585 --> 01:04:55,630
I'll let you do that.

803
01:04:56,413 --> 01:04:57,413
Okay?

804
01:04:59,851 --> 01:05:00,851
Okay.

805
01:05:42,546 --> 01:05:44,548
Did you call me, sir?

806
01:05:46,550 --> 01:05:50,250
Yes. Did you increase the
pressure of the volumetric?

807
01:05:50,424 --> 01:05:51,729
Yes.

808
01:05:51,903 --> 01:05:55,429
- New suspension?
- Yes. Ennio dealt with that.

809
01:05:57,257 --> 01:06:00,695
OK. You can go, then. It's late.

810
01:06:00,869 --> 01:06:02,479
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

811
01:06:02,566 --> 01:06:04,438
- Get some rest.
- Thank you.

812
01:06:31,682 --> 01:06:34,120
- Do you need a lift?
- Yes, thanks.

813
01:06:38,646 --> 01:06:40,256
I left my car gate 12.

814
01:06:40,387 --> 01:06:41,387
Okay.

815
01:06:42,998 --> 01:06:44,869
What are you doing still here?

816
01:06:44,956 --> 01:06:47,307
I was waiting for the results
of the team's analysis.

817
01:06:49,874 --> 01:06:50,874
Anyway,

818
01:06:53,661 --> 01:06:55,271
how's it going?

819
01:06:55,358 --> 01:06:56,664
Well, thanks.

820
01:06:56,751 --> 01:06:57,752
Why?

821
01:06:57,839 --> 01:06:59,928
I heard about Walter.

822
01:07:00,015 --> 01:07:02,800
Yeah, doesn't want to
know. He doesn't care.

823
01:07:03,714 --> 01:07:07,457
You can't always force someone
to do what they don't want do.

824
01:07:11,244 --> 01:07:12,244
So.

825
01:07:13,115 --> 01:07:14,115
Thanks.

826
01:07:16,336 --> 01:07:17,511
Were you waiting for me?

827
01:07:20,514 --> 01:07:22,037
I was a bit worried about you.

828
01:07:29,958 --> 01:07:31,046
- Goodnight.
- Bye.

829
01:07:32,526 --> 01:07:33,614
Thank you.

830
01:07:36,965 --> 01:07:38,967
See? Even the door.

831
01:08:34,544 --> 01:08:37,112
Now this way, follow
the finger please.

832
01:08:37,199 --> 01:08:38,199
So, up.

833
01:08:39,332 --> 01:08:40,811
Is he good?

834
01:08:40,898 --> 01:08:41,464
Last checks, then
he is good to go.

835
01:08:41,551 --> 01:08:43,466
Right.

836
01:08:43,553 --> 01:08:45,076
<i>Audi is</i> showing
all its strength.

837
01:08:45,207 --> 01:08:47,688
Okay, just follow here, far.

838
01:08:47,775 --> 01:08:50,386
And back.

839
01:08:50,517 --> 01:08:52,083
What are you doing?
Are you leaving?

840
01:08:52,171 --> 01:08:53,911
Yeah, I'm, I'm done here.

841
01:08:53,998 --> 01:08:56,020
I just need to go by the
university and finish some work.

842
01:08:56,044 --> 01:08:58,002
I'll meet you guys in Sanremo.

843
01:08:58,089 --> 01:08:59,352
What's wrong Cesare?

844
01:09:00,266 --> 01:09:03,007
Nothing, I can't
find my stopwatch.

845
01:09:03,094 --> 01:09:04,400
I think I left it in my hotel.

846
01:09:04,574 --> 01:09:06,315
I can go and get it.

847
01:09:06,446 --> 01:09:07,640
No, don't worry about
that. I can send someone.

848
01:09:07,664 --> 01:09:09,100
I'll go.

849
01:09:09,188 --> 01:09:10,188
I'm gonna go.

850
01:09:11,102 --> 01:09:11,929
Room 64.

851
01:09:12,016 --> 01:09:13,409
Yeah, okay.

852
01:09:13,540 --> 01:09:14,889
All right?

853
01:09:14,976 --> 01:09:16,096
- Yeah, you can go.
- Thanks.

854
01:09:58,280 --> 01:10:00,804
Team Lancia, Room 64 please.

855
01:10:14,601 --> 01:10:16,733
<i>Meanwhile,</i> the race is going on.

856
01:10:16,820 --> 01:10:20,563
<i>Michèle Mouton is the next
driver to start after Kurt.</i>

857
01:10:20,737 --> 01:10:22,696
<i>Wait, Udo Kurt has a problem.</i>

858
01:10:40,931 --> 01:10:43,083
<i>Okay, the Lancia driver has
apparently solved his problem</i>

859
01:10:43,107 --> 01:10:44,107
<i>with the helmet.</i>

860
01:10:57,513 --> 01:10:59,080
How does an engine work?

861
01:10:59,167 --> 01:11:01,996
Well there is a key, right?

862
01:11:02,126 --> 01:11:03,606
And then you have petrol.

863
01:11:03,693 --> 01:11:05,129
And when you turn
the key together

864
01:11:05,304 --> 01:11:07,610
with a petrol, it makes
like a huge explosion.

865
01:11:07,697 --> 01:11:10,787
That's how an engine
works. Understand?

866
01:11:10,874 --> 01:11:13,921
Hey, wanna know
how engines work?

867
01:11:18,578 --> 01:11:19,666
70.

868
01:11:20,797 --> 01:11:21,797
Easy right.

869
01:11:23,147 --> 01:11:24,147
Too hard.

870
01:11:28,805 --> 01:11:30,590
Give it to me.

871
01:11:30,677 --> 01:11:33,897
This is how four stroke internal
compression engines work.

872
01:11:33,984 --> 01:11:35,725
Suction, compression,

873
01:11:37,336 --> 01:11:39,338
explosion and discharge.

874
01:11:40,469 --> 01:11:41,905
100.

875
01:11:41,992 --> 01:11:44,081
Caution over the crest.

876
01:11:44,168 --> 01:11:45,953
50, right, and opens.

877
01:12:03,579 --> 01:12:05,929
20, left four junction.

878
01:12:06,016 --> 01:12:07,583
Left, three.

879
01:12:10,238 --> 01:12:13,197
20 and right, ease left three.

880
01:12:32,608 --> 01:12:35,263
<i>There's been an accident,
the car's on fire.</i>

881
01:12:35,872 --> 01:12:38,266
There's smoke.

882
01:12:42,705 --> 01:12:44,925
Repeat. Who had an
accident, where?

883
01:12:45,273 --> 01:12:46,579
It's impossible, look.

884
01:12:46,796 --> 01:12:50,234
- That's an easy curve.
- It's the suspension. I'll go.

885
01:12:53,368 --> 01:12:55,283
Vuda! Vuda!

886
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:09,210
Stop.

887
01:13:09,863 --> 01:13:11,255
Stop.

888
01:13:12,082 --> 01:13:13,997
We're withdrawing.

889
01:13:21,483 --> 01:13:23,224
We're withdrawing.

890
01:14:22,196 --> 01:14:24,154
So the co-driver is out danger.

891
01:14:24,241 --> 01:14:26,069
What about Kurt's condition?

892
01:14:26,156 --> 01:14:28,115
We'll wait to know for sure.

893
01:14:28,245 --> 01:14:30,334
Okay. Thank you.

894
01:14:37,733 --> 01:14:39,169
Cesare.

895
01:14:44,305 --> 01:14:46,176
He's in a coma.

896
01:14:46,307 --> 01:14:48,091
And?

897
01:14:48,178 --> 01:14:50,398
To simplify it, if zero
is the vegetative state

898
01:14:50,529 --> 01:14:52,095
from which it's
impossible to recover,

899
01:14:52,269 --> 01:14:55,577
and 10 is coming out of a coma,

900
01:14:57,579 --> 01:14:58,972
your driver is at one.

901
01:15:02,018 --> 01:15:03,018
What can we do?

902
01:15:05,587 --> 01:15:07,415
Medicine stops here.

903
01:15:07,502 --> 01:15:09,286
I shouldn't say
this as a doctor,

904
01:15:10,592 --> 01:15:11,854
now it's up to you.

905
01:15:16,467 --> 01:15:17,467
What do you mean?

906
01:15:18,905 --> 01:15:20,776
Let him know that you're there.

907
01:15:42,189 --> 01:15:43,407
I trust you.

908
01:16:15,309 --> 01:16:16,963
I heard from L'Avvocato.

909
01:16:17,311 --> 01:16:19,748
He was very sorry
about the accident.

910
01:16:22,229 --> 01:16:25,145
The insurance company will
make a payout to Kurt's family.

911
01:16:27,887 --> 01:16:30,629
- Did you find her?
- No, and no one's seen her.

912
01:16:33,457 --> 01:16:34,763
Go.

913
01:16:40,334 --> 01:16:41,857
The board has already told me

914
01:16:41,944 --> 01:16:44,686
they don't intend to
renew the racing budget

915
01:16:44,947 --> 01:16:46,557
for next year.

916
01:16:47,820 --> 01:16:49,952
There might not be a next year.

917
01:16:50,213 --> 01:16:52,607
Let's face it,
Cesare, like you say:

918
01:16:52,955 --> 01:16:55,349
no one wants to buy
a car that loses,

919
01:16:55,871 --> 01:16:58,221
let alone one you die in.

920
01:17:01,094 --> 01:17:02,661
He's still alive.

921
01:17:05,533 --> 01:17:07,187
He's still alive.

922
01:17:36,520 --> 01:17:40,002
You raced as a driver in
the 1961 Monte Carlo rally,

923
01:17:40,133 --> 01:17:43,049
but you didn't complete
because of an accident.

924
01:17:43,136 --> 01:17:45,921
Did you become a team manager
because you were scared?

925
01:17:46,966 --> 01:17:49,011
Sorry, I don't understand
what you're getting at.

926
01:17:49,185 --> 01:17:51,710
You have your drivers
racing in prototypes,

927
01:17:51,797 --> 01:17:55,757
normal cars that have
been pushed to the max

928
01:17:55,844 --> 01:17:59,630
to become really
powerful beasts.

929
01:17:59,761 --> 01:18:02,721
Do you not feel a sense of
responsibility for your driver

930
01:18:02,808 --> 01:18:04,679
who was just involved
in an accident?

931
01:18:07,073 --> 01:18:09,640
Obviously I'm very
worried about the guy,

932
01:18:09,728 --> 01:18:11,817
but to eliminate
risk from rallying

933
01:18:11,904 --> 01:18:14,471
would be eliminate
rallying itself.

934
01:18:14,602 --> 01:18:17,083
Earlier you compared
rallying to war.

935
01:18:17,170 --> 01:18:18,606
So let me quote
something for you.

936
01:18:18,693 --> 01:18:20,477
In the "Art of
War," Sun Tzu writes

937
01:18:20,564 --> 01:18:23,437
that it's possible
to know how to win

938
01:18:23,524 --> 01:18:26,745
without actually winning.

939
01:18:28,007 --> 01:18:29,617
Is that what's happening to you?

940
01:18:31,532 --> 01:18:34,709
I see you still don't
understand how this sport works.

941
01:18:34,796 --> 01:18:38,669
Here, you don't race to
overtake the other guy.

942
01:18:38,757 --> 01:18:40,367
You race against the clock,

943
01:18:40,454 --> 01:18:43,065
and if you lose, you
lose against yourself.

944
01:18:43,239 --> 01:18:45,328
Is that how you feel right now?

945
01:18:45,502 --> 01:18:46,808
What do you mean?

946
01:18:46,895 --> 01:18:48,941
Like someone who's
going to withdraw

947
01:18:49,028 --> 01:18:51,334
because he's lost
against himself.

948
01:18:55,556 --> 01:18:58,777
Love! Come, the cake!

949
01:18:59,299 --> 01:19:00,779
Coming.

950
01:19:01,910 --> 01:19:03,346
Sorry, I have to go.

951
01:19:04,478 --> 01:19:05,478
It's been a pleasure.

952
01:19:05,522 --> 01:19:06,523
Pleasure. Thank you.

953
01:19:06,654 --> 01:19:07,654
Thank you.

961
01:20:03,406 --> 01:20:08,194
I see, you've already
signed up for them.

962
01:20:08,281 --> 01:20:09,586
If you want to beat them,

963
01:20:09,673 --> 01:20:11,458
you have to first
get to know them.

964
01:20:11,545 --> 01:20:12,807
What are you celebrating?

965
01:20:13,808 --> 01:20:15,592
Birthday, my son.

966
01:20:17,551 --> 01:20:19,118
What are you doing here?

967
01:20:19,205 --> 01:20:20,206
Beehives.

968
01:20:21,033 --> 01:20:24,210
There's a really good craftsman
here in Turin, the best.

969
01:20:24,297 --> 01:20:26,081
Sure.

970
01:20:26,255 --> 01:20:27,822
Has the suspension collapsed?

971
01:20:30,259 --> 01:20:31,259
Yeah.

972
01:20:35,221 --> 01:20:36,221
How are you?

973
01:20:39,225 --> 01:20:40,225
Fine.

974
01:20:45,231 --> 01:20:46,449
Okay.

975
01:20:46,536 --> 01:20:49,496
That's what I wanted to hear.

976
01:20:49,670 --> 01:20:51,280
See you at Sanremo.

977
01:22:07,443 --> 01:22:09,706
Hard right. Left.

978
01:22:21,109 --> 01:22:23,894
Hard left, left,
and right, five.

979
01:22:32,251 --> 01:22:34,079
100, medium long left.

980
01:22:45,003 --> 01:22:47,353
- Good morning sir.
- Okay.

981
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:49,529
Audi was also very
fast on the asphalt.

982
01:22:49,659 --> 01:22:51,792
Now we have the second
stage in Tuscany.

983
01:22:51,879 --> 01:22:56,188
Ennio is coordinating
service trucks here and here.

984
01:22:56,362 --> 01:22:58,799
Then we have 200
kilometers of dirt road.

985
01:22:58,886 --> 01:23:02,063
In order to be at the stop
control in Liguria at 12:45.

986
01:23:02,237 --> 01:23:03,108
All clear?

987
01:23:03,195 --> 01:23:04,109
Yes sir.

988
01:23:04,196 --> 01:23:05,893
Good. Let's go.

989
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:06,720
Come on.

990
01:23:06,807 --> 01:23:07,807
Come on.

991
01:23:11,246 --> 01:23:13,031
Any news from Kurt?

992
01:23:14,119 --> 01:23:15,119
No.

993
01:23:19,776 --> 01:23:21,387
- Go!

994
01:23:21,517 --> 01:23:23,998
<i>Mikkola's</i> Audi
Quattro taking off.

995
01:23:24,129 --> 01:23:25,869
All right, what's the time?

996
01:23:35,096 --> 01:23:37,664
Three, two, one. Go!

997
01:23:43,974 --> 01:23:45,802
Fifty right, then a left open.

998
01:23:49,023 --> 01:23:50,981
70 right, three 120.

999
01:23:59,773 --> 01:24:02,428
Walter is first, second Mikkola,

1000
01:24:02,515 --> 01:24:05,431
third and fourth
Alen and Vudafieri.

1001
01:24:05,518 --> 01:24:06,910
The Germans are surrounded.

1002
01:24:08,390 --> 01:24:09,826
Be sure they have some rest.

1003
01:24:10,914 --> 01:24:12,699
Yeah, I'll make them
a herbal tea tonight,

1004
01:24:12,786 --> 01:24:14,527
help them sleep.

1005
01:24:14,614 --> 01:24:16,635
And I've got some maltodextrins
for them in the morning.

1006
01:24:16,659 --> 01:24:19,314
- What are they?
- Relax.

1007
01:24:19,401 --> 01:24:22,491
They're just water-soluble
complex carbohydrates.

1008
01:24:24,232 --> 01:24:26,060
You know what to
do. It's your job.

1009
01:24:26,147 --> 01:24:28,584
Yeah. And what's yours?

1010
01:24:28,715 --> 01:24:31,457
Mine? My job is to win.

1011
01:24:33,633 --> 01:24:35,983
Why is it so important?

1012
01:24:36,070 --> 01:24:38,594
I've been with you guys
for a while now and I,

1013
01:24:38,681 --> 01:24:40,944
I still don't understand it.

1014
01:24:41,075 --> 01:24:42,990
Don't try to understand.

1015
01:24:43,077 --> 01:24:45,558
If you try to understand,
you will never win.

1016
01:24:45,732 --> 01:24:48,865
But why do you do it?

1017
01:24:48,952 --> 01:24:51,433
I mean the drivers, my father.

1018
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:54,741
Why do they risk their
lives just to win?

1019
01:24:55,872 --> 01:24:59,746
- There's more to it.
- What more is there than life?

1020
01:24:59,833 --> 01:25:01,313
Racing to go nowhere.

1021
01:25:02,401 --> 01:25:03,880
Where is not the point.

1022
01:25:04,707 --> 01:25:05,795
The point is how.

1023
01:25:07,580 --> 01:25:08,581
As fast as you can.

1024
01:25:12,324 --> 01:25:13,324
And death?

1025
01:25:14,978 --> 01:25:16,632
Is it worth it?

1026
01:25:16,719 --> 01:25:19,026
Death is afraid of
those who pursue it.

1027
01:25:21,724 --> 01:25:23,639
Instead of waiting for it,

1028
01:25:23,726 --> 01:25:24,901
we run after it,

1029
01:25:25,772 --> 01:25:27,121
and it moves away.

1030
01:25:31,517 --> 01:25:32,517
Jane?

1031
01:25:35,173 --> 01:25:36,173
Thanks.

1032
01:25:37,436 --> 01:25:39,394
Thank you for what
you're doing for us.

1033
01:25:54,583 --> 01:25:56,039
Roöhrl should arrive
at the time control

1034
01:25:56,063 --> 01:25:57,063
10 minutes earlier.

1035
01:25:58,413 --> 01:26:00,328
Okay, see you at the checkpoint.

1036
01:26:19,434 --> 01:26:21,349
What's going on?

1037
01:26:29,923 --> 01:26:31,011
What's wrong man?

1038
01:26:31,098 --> 01:26:32,404
During the road section

1039
01:26:32,621 --> 01:26:33,946
I felt a vibration
of the clutch pedal.

1040
01:26:33,970 --> 01:26:35,842
Sinister noise, so I stopped.

1041
01:26:35,929 --> 01:26:37,322
I think it's the bearing.

1042
01:26:37,496 --> 01:26:38,496
It's the bearing.

1043
01:26:38,540 --> 01:26:39,280
So change it.

1044
01:26:39,411 --> 01:26:40,499
We can't.

1045
01:26:40,629 --> 01:26:41,761
What do you mean we can't?

1046
01:26:41,848 --> 01:26:43,502
We don't have another one.

1047
01:26:44,198 --> 01:26:46,156
Why don't we have
another one, sorry?

1048
01:26:46,244 --> 01:26:49,986
Sir, in 10 years of rallying,
I've never seen a broken bushing.

1049
01:26:50,248 --> 01:26:51,727
Do you realize
what you're saying?

1050
01:26:52,075 --> 01:26:55,078
It's like a pilot not having a
parachute because he's never crashed!

1051
01:26:55,165 --> 01:26:57,559
Even if we had one...

1052
01:26:57,864 --> 01:26:59,735
We have to be at
the stop control...

1053
01:26:59,822 --> 01:27:02,869
At 12.45, I know what time we need
to be there, is that clear? I know.

1054
01:27:03,565 --> 01:27:04,914
12.45.

1055
01:27:05,001 --> 01:27:06,307
Okay.

1056
01:27:23,498 --> 01:27:27,197
Excuse me, are you saying if we had
another bearing you could change it?

1057
01:27:28,416 --> 01:27:30,766
If we had one, technically
it would be possible.

1058
01:27:46,260 --> 01:27:48,306
There, you see? You
only need to ask.

1059
01:27:53,398 --> 01:27:56,096
- Vuda, come on!
- Sir, again? What's going on?

1060
01:27:56,531 --> 01:27:59,229
Nothing. We need your
car. We need the bushing.

1061
01:27:59,491 --> 01:28:00,771
Come on, go take
a shower, go on.

1062
01:28:00,927 --> 01:28:03,364
Sir, that way Mikkola's
first and Alén second.

1063
01:28:03,451 --> 01:28:06,498
Vudafieri would be third, the first
podium of his life. It's not fair.

1064
01:28:06,889 --> 01:28:09,065
You have 50 minutes
to change the bushing.

1065
01:28:12,504 --> 01:28:13,722
49.

1066
01:28:13,983 --> 01:28:15,898
- That's not how you win.
- What did you say?

1067
01:28:16,159 --> 01:28:17,726
- That's not how you win.
- So what is?

1068
01:28:17,987 --> 01:28:20,338
- Do you know how to win?
- No, but not like that.

1069
01:28:20,425 --> 01:28:23,166
- What do you know about winning?
- I'm not doing it.

1070
01:28:23,428 --> 01:28:25,255
Are you kidding?

1071
01:28:26,735 --> 01:28:29,129
- What did you say, sorry?
- I'm not doing it.

1072
01:28:29,216 --> 01:28:30,216
Cesare.

1073
01:28:32,524 --> 01:28:34,526
They just called me
from the hospital,

1074
01:28:35,657 --> 01:28:36,963
Kurt's back with us again.

1075
01:28:39,182 --> 01:28:40,182
Kurt is back.

1076
01:28:42,708 --> 01:28:44,144
He's back with us again.

1077
01:28:57,113 --> 01:28:58,506
Kurt is back.

1078
01:29:02,292 --> 01:29:04,425
Change this fucking bushing.

1079
01:29:05,078 --> 01:29:09,430
Let's go, we have an hour,
come on. Come on, quick.

1080
01:29:34,629 --> 01:29:36,414
Brake, like that.

1081
01:29:38,459 --> 01:29:40,069
We're almost done.

1082
01:29:44,334 --> 01:29:46,424
- Done.
- Come on!

1083
01:29:47,512 --> 01:29:50,036
Walter, you have to fly, okay?

1084
01:29:50,906 --> 01:29:52,168
You're on time.

1085
01:30:36,952 --> 01:30:38,737
So now we're at the final stage.

1086
01:30:38,824 --> 01:30:41,522
Good strong team, so
we're sure to win.

1087
01:30:41,696 --> 01:30:43,176
Mikkola is our strongest player.

1088
01:30:53,708 --> 01:30:56,232
Sir, from here, the
weather is variable.

1089
01:30:56,319 --> 01:30:58,191
There could be
communication problems.

1090
01:30:58,321 --> 01:31:00,280
Sir? Sir, can you hear me?

1091
01:31:02,935 --> 01:31:04,240
<i>Here we are at the last stage</i>

1092
01:31:04,327 --> 01:31:05,894
<i>of the rally out of Sanremo.</i>

1093
01:31:08,027 --> 01:31:09,898
Sir? Sir, can you hear me?

1094
01:31:09,985 --> 01:31:12,640
What did you say, can you
repeat please? I can't hear you.

1095
01:31:12,727 --> 01:31:13,748
There could be
communication problems.

1096
01:31:13,772 --> 01:31:15,208
I'll keep you updated.

1097
01:31:17,123 --> 01:31:18,994
Okay, let's stay in touch.

1098
01:31:19,081 --> 01:31:20,561
<i>Fiorio's Lancia
and Gumpert's Audi</i>

1099
01:31:20,735 --> 01:31:23,303
<i>play it all out
in one last stage.</i>

1100
01:31:23,433 --> 01:31:25,000
<i>Whoever wins today will conquer</i>

1101
01:31:25,174 --> 01:31:27,525
<i>the 1983 Constructors'
Championship.</i>

1102
01:31:30,963 --> 01:31:34,575
Mikkola leads the championship
and seems to be the favorite.

1103
01:31:37,447 --> 01:31:39,232
<i>Alen, second Lancia driver.</i>

1104
01:31:43,018 --> 01:31:44,585
<i>And finally, Roöhrl.</i>

1105
01:31:44,672 --> 01:31:46,369
<i>Will he be able to defeat Audi?</i>

1106
01:31:47,327 --> 01:31:48,807
<i>Today we are making
history here.</i>

1107
01:31:48,894 --> 01:31:50,025
Go.

1108
01:32:04,866 --> 01:32:08,783
Mr. Fiorio, I can
see Roöhrl's Lancia.

1109
01:32:08,870 --> 01:32:10,263
He is driving very well.

1110
01:32:10,437 --> 01:32:12,047
According to intermediate time,

1111
01:32:12,178 --> 01:32:14,006
Roöhrl has 12 seconds
lead over Mikkola.

1112
01:32:14,093 --> 01:32:15,921
12 seconds ahead.

1113
01:32:16,008 --> 01:32:17,008
Okay.

1114
01:32:48,214 --> 01:32:49,258
Now the road is wet.

1115
01:32:49,432 --> 01:32:50,433
It's more difficult.

1116
01:32:54,089 --> 01:32:56,701
Roöhrl might lose a few seconds.

1117
01:32:58,616 --> 01:33:00,313
Walter, can you hear me?

1118
01:33:00,487 --> 01:33:01,487
Walter?

1119
01:33:02,228 --> 01:33:04,317
Push on that
fucking pedal, okay?

1120
01:33:04,404 --> 01:33:06,101
Because we can still do it.

1121
01:33:06,188 --> 01:33:07,450
Mikkola is ahead.

1122
01:33:07,537 --> 01:33:09,452
It's not the time to give up.

1123
01:33:09,627 --> 01:33:10,715
Give everything you can.

1124
01:33:10,845 --> 01:33:12,325
You must recover 10 seconds.

1125
01:33:12,412 --> 01:33:15,415
Push, push, push,
it's now or never.

1126
01:33:17,112 --> 01:33:17,896
Okay.

1127
01:33:17,983 --> 01:33:18,983
Good.

1128
01:33:46,315 --> 01:33:47,447
There is smoke!

1129
01:33:47,534 --> 01:33:49,275
I cannot hear you. Repeat.

1130
01:33:49,449 --> 01:33:51,581
There was smoke. I can't see.

1131
01:33:51,712 --> 01:33:54,759
There is smoke. A
car caught fire.

1132
01:33:54,889 --> 01:33:56,761
Whose car has caught fire?

1133
01:33:56,848 --> 01:33:59,067
I don't understand,
I can't see well.

1134
01:33:59,154 --> 01:34:01,679
I can't tell if it's
Mikkola or Roöhrl's Lancia.

1135
01:34:03,463 --> 01:34:05,770
Walter? Walter, can hear me?

1136
01:34:05,944 --> 01:34:08,773
Can you hear me? Walter, please!

1137
01:36:33,265 --> 01:36:34,309
Are you crazy, Walter?

1138
01:36:34,440 --> 01:36:37,138
Why are you slowing down?

1139
01:36:46,147 --> 01:36:48,889
Walter we're gonna
lose the race.

1140
01:37:32,715 --> 01:37:34,587
<i>Alén crosses</i> the
finish line first

1141
01:37:34,717 --> 01:37:37,459
<i>and wins the Constructors'
Championship for Lancia.</i>

1142
01:37:37,546 --> 01:37:39,244
<i>Mikkola is out of the race.</i>

1143
01:37:41,246 --> 01:37:42,682
<i>This is rallying.</i>

1144
01:38:57,235 --> 01:38:59,280
Are you happy? You won.

1145
01:39:01,413 --> 01:39:03,981
You should be happy
too, you didn't.

1146
01:39:06,548 --> 01:39:10,422
Only losers always
wanna win, don't they?

1147
01:39:10,509 --> 01:39:12,598
That's right.

1148
01:39:39,059 --> 01:39:40,365
They are happy.

1149
01:39:40,539 --> 01:39:41,975
We are not happy.

1150
01:40:00,646 --> 01:40:02,387
Next season.

1151
01:40:10,830 --> 01:40:15,400
Crazy, yes we are very,
very happy, as you can see.

1152
01:40:15,530 --> 01:40:18,098
We did not expect to win.
